# Hi there 👋

Hey! I’m Ridwan, a software engineer from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy building software that scales, using proven engineering practices. I’m big on writing clean, maintainable code, designing solid systems, and making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. Testing? Absolutely—I believe it’s a must! I’m always curious and eager to learn new tools and technologies to level up my skills. If you’re into building cool stuff or just want to chat tech, let’s connect on [X](https://x.com/ridwanobafunso)!
